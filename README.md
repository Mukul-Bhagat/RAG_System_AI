# RAG_System_AI
Architected a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system in Python, engineering a data pipeline to ingest, chunk, and embed PDF content into a vector database for semantic search.  Orchestrated the Q&amp;A workflow using LangChain with local LLMs via Ollama, and built a real-time, interactive UI with Streamlit for document queries.
